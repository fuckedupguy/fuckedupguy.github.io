And now JS getting huge attension. because of early days JS only used to add some interactivity on client-side. but now JS can also be used on server-side. with google chrome JS engine that is chrome's V8 engine powered <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs</a> you can run JS on server-side.

And there are lots of server side frameworks eg:- express for nodejs, meteor and lots of client side JS frameworks eg:- <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">angularjs</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">reactjs</a> and etc... with all these server-side and client side JS solution, you can built pretty much anything you imagine. so that's why you should learn JavaScript. it's a one language that can be used to build complete solutions. so there are more other reasons to learn JavaScript. I will add more reason to this post later.
