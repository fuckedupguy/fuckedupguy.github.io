First of guys I just wanna tell you this. I do have good JavaScript knowlage already. but I thought to re touch all the part of JS. with new ECMA-262 JS version 6, whole lot of features and changes added to the vanilla JS. so it's much better to have good knowlage and practice on these updated technology.

So I will create new blog post under JavaScript category on this blog when I re-touch every part of JavaScript.
